Just a silly project to see if I can create WordPress plug-ins. It displays a list of GitHub repositories or the README.md of a single repository.

## Description

You define the plug-in with the shortcode `list-github-repositories`. Don't forget to define the user whose plug-ins you want to display, else you'll get mine.

Afterwards you get a nice list with your repositories.

Similarly you can use a shortcode like `[show-github-repository user="slothsoft" repository="wordpress-github-repositories"]` to show a single repository's HTML. GitHub parses the HTML itself, so you don't need to fear unsupported markup.

## Installation

Installing "GitHub Repositories" can be done either by searching for "GitHub Repositories" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
